At the COP26 negotiations in Glasgow, nature will be discussed as central to strategies on lessening climate change.
But although the third ‘Because the Ocean’ declaration will be launched by coastal/island nations from across the globe, alongside other blue carbon events, these are likely to play second fiddle to the nitty-gritty of carbon counting that goes on in the official negotiations.
This is the fifth COP since the signing of the Paris Agreement. Many big-emitter countries are struggling to demonstrate how their promises to reduce emissions will be enough.
And in some cases, even our language is lacking. Mentions of the ocean during negotiations have been few and far between.
We have known for decades that ending overfishing is the right thing to do for both fisheries and for biodiversity.
As scientists who study fish and fisheries, we contend that every country with an ocean-going fleet can take steps to enact ocean-climate action today by phasing out destructive fishing practices (including overfishing), and counting fish as part of their national inventories of carbon emissions and storage.
A healthy ocean isn’t a sideshow to climate action. It is essential. And we need to start treating it as such.

Coral reefs might only cover a tiny fraction of the ocean floor, but they are home to around a quarter of all marine species. Many though are dying due to warming oceans and pollution. In this episode, Ocean looks at what's been done to not only preserve reefs but also bring them back to life.

"We are outplanting more than seven and a half thousand pieces of coral this year over the 10 restoration sites we have... On every tree, in every nursery we have here, all the corals are from the same genotype. And this way, when they are put together or they touch together, they will grow together and fuse together," says Reef Renewal's restoration technician Ernst Noyons.
Genetic similarities within the coral, however, can make the reef vulnerable. A new restoration technique can eliminate this by using the coral’s reproductive cells instead of fragmenting.
"We use the sexual reproduction of corals to produce new, genetically unique individuals. And it's very important because the higher is the genetic diversity on the reef, the more resilient is the reef itself," Francesca says.
The coral releases reproductive cells into the water during what’s known as “mass spawning events”. Researchers collect these, fertilising them in the lab, to produce larvae that then settles on star-shaped ceramic plates that are placed in floating pools at sea.
"We make sure that we have a lot of larvae settle on this stars, and then we bring the stars, in order of thousands, and we outplant them back to the reef - and then we monitor the growth of the little settlement on it." explains Virdis.
Klein Bonaire is a small protected island off Bonaire's west coast and home to a vast reef of staghorn corals. Two thousand square meters in size, this is just one of Reef Renewal’s many plantations. The team stress everyone can play their part — be it, using eco-friendly sunscreens, making a donation, or even by becoming a coral restoration volunteer themselves. Divers can take a two-day training course to learn the basics on how to maintain a coral nursery.
"Almost 80 percent of the dive shops in Bonaire — they're part of the programme now, and the people are super, super enthusiastic," Reef Renewal's diving instructor Guillermo Alcorta tells us.
A marine biologist from Belgium taking part in the training tells us: "I think reef preservation projects are vitally important! I really wanted to learn about it in much more depth so I could play a role."
Another marine biologist from the UK, who is also taking part in the training, says: "Sometimes it seems very far away, it's under the water — how can you help? But this is giving people a hands on opportunity to make a difference.''
This work by enthusiasts can make a huge difference in the preservation of local reefs. But the long-term survival of coral will depend on our ability to reverse both global warming and eliminate other threats to marine life in the decades to come.
In honour of World Oceans Day, she writes exclusively for Euronews Green about the importance of the oceans for the health of the planet and the difference that carbon removal projects can make.
To me, the ocean is many things. As an environmentalist, it’s an invaluable resource that’s home to some of the world’s most incredible species. As a mother, it’s an absolute wonder for my 9-year-old son. As an explorer, it’s a source of inspiration and adventure. As The TreadRight Foundation's ‘Planet’ Ambassador, it’s an enormous source of hope for our future.
Today on World Oceans Day, we advocate for the protection of our world’s ocean waters and habitats. I could scare you with the litany of risks facing our oceans. But I’d prefer to instil hope for the potential within our oceans to right some of our most egregious wrongs.
Ocean restoration is key
The wellbeing of humanity relies on the wellbeing of the planet. The list of challenges we collectively face can feel endless. The list of solutions addressing climate change, however, is steadily growing, and we may have to look no further than the waters surrounding us.
Our oceans need protection. We must eliminate the eight million pieces of daily plastic waste polluting our waterways by pursuing the long-term solution: prevention. But we wouldn’t be telling the whole story without addressing the fact that ocean restoration will unlock a natural means to mitigate humanity’s excessive carbon footprint and empower climate action.
The power of a common rock to capture 1GT of carbon every year
I believe in big, bold ideas that are based in nature and backed by science. I believe each one of us is the solution. This is why, for the past 10 years, I’ve worked with the TreadRight Foundation to share the sustainable travel initiatives it supports worldwide. Two of the latest projects are marine-based carbon removal solutions, chosen for the way they support TTC’s Climate Action Plan.
TreadRight’s first carbon removal partner is Project Vesta. They are exploring the natural power of the ocean as a carbon sink, while also tackling the problem of ocean acidification. The organisation is on a mission to harness the natural power of the oceans to remove a trillion tonnes of excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
They do this by taking olivine, a naturally occurring rock found on every continent, crushing it up and moving it to beaches or coastal areas where it can be broken down further by the natural weathering process of wave action. As the olivine sand breaks down, carbon dioxide is removed from the air and becomes bicarbonate, which is used by marine organisms in their shells and eventually ends up as limestone on the ocean floor.
Project Vesta estimates olivine could capture 1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide a year if deployed on just 0.25 per cent of global shelf seas. It would take 16 billion tree seedlings growing for 10 years to sequester the same amount of carbon.
Vesta has pilot beaches in the Caribbean and Hawaii. When they have validated that the process works and is ecologically sound, they will share their results so Coastal Carbon Capture can be replicated in coastal areas worldwide.
These projects, which harness the power of the ocean to ultimately benefit people, wildlife and our planet’s future, show us the solutions we require already exist, provided to us by nature. I call on governments and businesses worldwide to seek out these solutions and help them scale so we may all benefit.
A farming technique ‘to heal our planet’
GreenWave is trying to show the many benefits of ‘zero input farming.’ GreenWave is studying how kelp, extracted from the ocean, can be added to soil to increase its carbon storage potential, while decreasing harmful nitrous oxide emissions on regenerative land farms.
